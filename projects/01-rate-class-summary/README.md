This project provides a SQL query that categorizes customers into rate classes based on their meter class codes in the enQuesta database. The query counts the number of distinct customers per rate class for a specific application, focusing on active electric meters.

The query uses a CASE statement to map meter class codes to meaningful categories such as Residential, Industrial, Small Medium Commercial, Municipal, Pump, Bars Fiber, SCADA Monitoring Fee, and Other.

The output of the query is a summary count of customers grouped by these customer classes, which can be used to analyze customer distribution across different rate classes.

This report can be used by analysts to understand customer segmentation and assist with decision-making processes related to billing, customer service, and utility management.
